INTERFACES:
    Interfaces + Classes ===> Strong Code Reuse.

    An interface creates a new type, describing the property names and value types of an object.
    
    General strategy for reusable code in TS:
        1.) Create functions that accept arguments that are typed (may be with interfaces).
        2.) Objects/Classes can decide to "implement" a given interface to work with a function.
