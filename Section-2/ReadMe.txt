BASIC TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT:
    Type: An easy way to refer to the different properties and functions/methods that a value has.
    Value: Anything that can be assigned to a variable (functions, classes, objects, null, int, etc).
    Examples: string, number, boolean, Date, Todo (user-defined, see section-1).

    TYPES:
        PRIMITIVE TYPES:
            number, boolean, undefined, string, null, void, symbol, ...
        
        OBJECT TYPES:
            functions, arrays, classes, objects, ...

        Types are used by the TS compiler to analyzer our code for errors.
        Allows us to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.

        Types will be used everywhere in TS.
