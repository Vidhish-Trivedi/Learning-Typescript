CLASSES:
    A class is a blueprint to create an object with some fields/attributes and methods.

    MODIFIERS:
        Key words (public, private, protected {default is public}).
        Used to restrict access to attributes and methods.
        When using Inheritance, we should not change the modifier while overriding an existing method/attribute.

    WHEN TO USE CLASSES:
        Object-Oriented Principles!
